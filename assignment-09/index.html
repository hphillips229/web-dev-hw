        <h2>How it all Started</h2>
        <p>In the spring of 2012 founder, Chuck Mumford, was traveling to the Teton Mountains for a ski touring adventure. Sunglasses being a very important part of touring trips, Chuck had his current "high-end sport" sunglasses in tow which quickly broke and left him looking for more. He started developing Pit Vipers in the Spring of 2012 as a rugged product that could be shot, sat on, shoved in pockets, run over, and mostly maintain their sun and wind bucking ability.</p>
