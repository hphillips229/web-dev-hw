      <pre>
        Well I know you can't work in fast food all your life
        But don't sign that paper tonight
        She said but it's too late.
        I don't remember what I read
        Don't remember what they said
        Guess it doesn't matter
        Guess it doesn't matter anymore
        You're gonna go to the record store
        You're gonna give'em all your money
        Radio plays what they want you to hear
        They tell me it's cool but I just don't believe it
        Sell out, with me oh yea, sell out, with me tonight
        Record company's gonna give me lots of money and
        Everything's gonna be all right
        No more flippin' burgers puttin' on my silly hat you know
        I don't want that no more
        And I didn't ask when we'd get paid
        I quit my day job anyway
        Guess it doesn't matter, guess it doesn't matter anymore
        Coz you're gonna go to the record store
        You're gonna give'em all your money
        Radio plays what they want you to hear
        Tell me it's cool, I just don't believe it
        Sell out, with me oh yea
        Sell out with me tonight
        The record company's gonna give me lots of money
        and everything's gonna be
        And I don't think it'll be so bad
        And I know it won't be so bad
        Cause the man said "that's the way it is"
        and the man said "it don't get better than this" no no no
        So I signed on to the record company
        they say they're gonna give me lot's of money
        if i play what they want you to hear
        they tell me it's cool, and i sure believe it
        Sell out, with me oh yea
        Sell out with me tonight
        The record company's gonna give me lots of money
        and everything's gonna be all right
        Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
        The record company's gonna make everything all right
        Baby don't you sign that paper tonight she said
        But I can't work in fast food all my life
